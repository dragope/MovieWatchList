# WatchList - Work in progress

App created with React, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase and the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to create lists of movies to watch and the ones you already watched, as well as browsing by actors and crew to explore their work in depth.

This is a work in progress, so the version you see in the Netlify link is WAY behind the one currently being worked on. Feel free to clone this repo and explore it and stay tuned for more updates!
