# WatchList - Work in progress

App created with React.js, Node.js, MongoDB (Atlas), Firebase and the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to create lists of movies to watch and the ones you already watched, as well as browsing by actors and crew to explore their work in depth.

Also used Heroku to host the backend and Netlify to host the frontend.

This is a work in progress, so expect changes, corrections, updates, improvements and new features to come!
